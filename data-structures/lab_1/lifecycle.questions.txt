1. Is this the equivlent of a java toString()?:

friend ostream& operator<<(ostream& output, const MyObject& obj);

2. Does the copy constructor make an exact replica in memory? Or does it simply point to the same object it was copied from?

3. Will we ever have to put meaningful code into the destructor body, or is it all predefined by c++?
